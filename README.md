# healthcheck

A simple CLI tool to health check a Minecraft server inside a Docker container.

This tool is based on the package [minepong](https://github.com/andrewtian/minepong) from [andrewtian](https://github.com/andrewtian). We are just using our fork for API and availability consistency reasons.
